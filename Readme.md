## Reddit Image Scrapper

I have created this class to scrap images from any subreddit of reddit.com. 

The Class requires 3 parameters

1. Folder_path - The path where you want to save all of your downloaded images from Reddit

2. Num_scrolls - Subreddits pages in Reddit have an infinite scroll feature. The more we scroll, the more images are loaded on the webpage. The number of scroll attributes specifies the number of times we want to scroll a webpage completely

3. Page_link - The link to the subreddit page
